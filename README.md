# Godot Avatar VR Demo

This project is designed as a minimum testing project for V-Sekai's character controller and avatar rig.
It is based on the intention of building an ongoing testbed to tune the for a high quality VR experience,
making it easier for people to contribute, and possibly providing a foundation for people wishing to include
full-body avatar-ready controllers in their own standalone VR Godot projects.

Unlike the main v-sekai-game repo, it will not include features like networking or user generated content.
